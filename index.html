        <h3>Welcome to my World!</h3>
        <p class="intro">I'm a web designer, programmer & digital illustrator by day & hunter for the perfect Sicilian slice by night (& most weekdays...and weekends too...) Based & raised in NYC, I have an extensive background in multiple design
          disciplines & love to merge digital with analog. I'm the founder of Lost Lagoon Loungewear & have a super cool side-kick pup, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beingernesto">Ernesto</a>!</p>

          <h4>Design & Development</h4>
          <p class="skill-text">My first introduction to HTML & CSS, like many in my generation, was through <a href="https://myspace.windows93.net/index.php?id=4828">Myspace</a> (Kudos to <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv1_tlWjI00">JankenPop</a> for bringing back the party!) Though the internet has evolved since then & web design has become much more sophisticated, who doesn't still love a good glitter gif now and
            again? <br><br>In college I created & coded web based multimedia projects combining fiction with photography. Post college, I've worked as a VP of Fashion Design in NYC's Garment District, honing my Photoshop & Illustrator skills. Often in charge of
            designing & creating websites for brands, it was a great incubator for developing design & programming skills. This lead me to my true love--Web Design & Development: a perfect synergy of problem solving, trend analysis, good design &
            functionality.</p>

          <h4>Illustration</h4>
          <p class="skill-text">I began oil painting at 7 & have been creating ever since! My favorite mediums are acrylic paint, colored pencil, digital sketching & more often than not, a good ol' bic pen. My style is more abstract & whimsical (&
            sometimes just strange.) I believe that hand drawn illustrations can bring a warmth & joy often missing in digital media. My mission is to make the internet a more joyful place, one website at a time! You can find some of my artwork
            <a href="">here</a>.</p>

          <h4>Writing</h4>
          <p class="skill-text">Writing--espeically creatively--has always been a love of mine. I followed that passion to a BA in Creative Writing. It allows me to cleary communicate complex ideas in a way that is concise, easily
            understandable & engaging. From poetry to web copy-- I haven't met a word I didn't like (except for moist. Moist can go scratch.)</p>
